was brought into being in response to
Din's formation of the land, Farore's
spawning of life and Nayru's creation of
law and order. Legend tells of the
imprisoning of the Primodial Chaos in Din's
earth in the beginning, and the frequent
repeated attempts to trap it again since.
All of this repeated bloodshed is required
by Nayru's "Law" and her pathetic notion
of "Fate" or "Destiny".
